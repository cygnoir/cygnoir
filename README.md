### Hi there 👋

<!--

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to subvert the dominant paradigm.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combat misinformation and disinformation!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with remaining strong in the face of fascism.
- 💬 Ask me about my library fines. (Not anymore — our library got rid of them!)
- 📫 How to reach me: carrier porcupine
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
